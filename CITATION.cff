      Depthwise Convolutional Neural Network for Multi-Band
      Automatic Quasars Classification in ATLAS, MNRAS, 2023

abstract: >
  In recent years, the astronomical scientific community has
  made significant efforts to automate quasarsâ€™ detection.
  Automatic classification of these objects is challenging
  since they are very distant and appear as point sources,
  outnumbered by other sources. Thus, performing automatic
  morphological classification is not straightforward; color
  dimension seems better as a key concept. Previous work
  using machine learning tools has proposed classifiers that
  use features such as magnitude and color, working only for
  quasar representation, which requires high-quality
  observational data that is not always available. Those
  features are computationally costly in extensive image
  surveys like VST ATLAS. With the continuous developments
  in Deep Learning architectures, we find a powerful tool to
  perform automatic classification from images, where
  capturing information from different bands takes relevance
  in this kind of approach. In this work, we developed a new
  Quasar selection method that we hope to apply to the
  complete ATLAS survey in subsequent papers, where the
  completeness and efficiency of Depthwise Architecture will
  be compared to more standard methods such as selection on
  the colour-colour diagrams and machine-learning
  feature-based methods. This automatic quasar
  classification tool uses images in u, g, i, z bands
  available in ATLAS, heading towards new survey
  requirements facing the big data era. We propose a Deep
  Learning architecture based on depthwise convolutional
  units that work directly with ATLAS images, reduced by the
  VST pipeline. Our model reaches an accuracy of 96.53% with
  a quasar classification f1-score of 96.49%, a very
  competitive benchmark compared to previous unscalable
  approaches.
